/// Owns the conversation call: an explicit voice session with a
/// coding agent.
///
/// One call exists at a time. The call shortcut toggles it — a press
/// while a call is active hangs up, identically to Escape. A call
/// starts only when the frontmost window hosts a coding-agent session
/// and dictation is not recording, so the two features never contend
/// for audio. `toggle` claims or releases the call without suspending,
/// so two rapid presses cannot start two calls; the dictation check
/// happens inside the claimed call task.
///
/// While the call listens, the streaming provider publishes
/// `TurnSignal`s for the capture session. A pause sends the turn only
/// when speech was transcribed — silence and background noise never
/// send — and the dictation key sends immediately. The conversation
/// is pinned to the session resolved at call start: every sent turn
/// is delivered to it — refocusing its application first when the
/// user has wandered — then submitted and watched.
///
/// The microphone is one continuous concern for the life of the call.
/// A send does not close it: the waiting phase hosts a live capture
/// session of its own, so speech after a send endpoints exactly as it
/// does while listening and supersedes the watch. Agent replies weave
/// around that speech instead of interrupting it — a reply arriving
/// mid-speech queues behind it, progress messages drop as stale, and
/// a final response that never actually played is always spoken. An
/// empty pause re-arms listening rather than closing the mic.
///
/// Narrations play over a watch-only, echo-cancelled microphone:
/// strong speech stops the voice mid-sentence, everything heard under
/// the voice is discarded — a recognizer reads reverberant residual
/// ears cannot — and a fresh clean session opens the moment the voice
/// stops. A turn whose whole utterance is a spoken meta-command —
/// "hang up" — executes against the call itself and is never sent.
